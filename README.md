# NFL Quarterback Analysis: A Multi-Faceted Approach to Defining Elite Play

## Executive Summary

This project analyzes NFL play-by-play data from 2019-2023 to move beyond traditional metrics and build a multi-faceted definition of "elite" quarterback performance. The analysis integrates three distinct methodologies: situational performance (1st vs. 3rd Down), longitudinal trend analysis, and unsupervised machine learning. The capstone of the project is the deployment of a KMeans clustering model, which successfully segments players into three distinct archetypes and reveals that "elite" status is defined by a rare combination of both high accuracy and high downfield aggressiveness.

## Key Features
* **Deep Situational Analysis:** Goes beyond the box score to analyze performance on crucial downs.
* **Time-Series Visualization:** Tracks QB performance over a 5-year period against the league average.
* **Unsupervised Machine Learning:** Implements KMeans clustering to identify data-driven QB archetypes.
* **Interactive Data Visualization:** Uses Plotly to create an interactive bubble chart for exploring the QB archetypes.

## Tech Stack
* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** Python, pandas, NumPy
* **Data Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn
* **Data Sourcing:** `nfl_data_py` Python library
